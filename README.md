# Codepen
Introduction:
The codepen application allows web developers and designers to write, edit, and showcase HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets.
It provides a user-friendly interface with a built-in editor where users can write and test code in real time.
Users can create and share "pens," self-contained code snippets, or small projects. Pens can include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and can be previewed and edited directly in the browser.

Installation and Setup:

Clone the project from the GitHub repository onto your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your web browser to view the application.
Usage:
The application consists of three sections: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can add code snippets to each section and preview the output in the preview pane.

HTML Section:
In this section, you can add your HTML code. The HTML code will be rendered in the preview pane.

CSS Section:
In this section, you can add your CSS code. The CSS code will be applied to the HTML code and rendered in the preview pane.

JavaScript Section:
In this section, you can add your JavaScript code. The JavaScript code will be executed when the page loads and will modify the HTML and CSS code according to your code.

Preview Pane:
The preview pane is where the output of your code will be rendered. It shows the result of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
